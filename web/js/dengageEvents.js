/* ============================================================================
   THE ONLY MODULE IN A DEMO THAT TALKS TO DENGAGE.

   Handoff 1.3, 15a. CLAUDE.md 1b. Guard check: event-single-source.

   Nothing else calls dengage('ec:...'), dengage('pageView') or
   dengage('sendDeviceEvent'). CI refuses it. That is not a style preference,
   it is the whole of how one rule can cover every call site.

   WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS.

   Demos write the six standard ecommerce tables, the same ones five live demo
   sites and two mobile apps write. Columns cannot be added to them and rows
   cannot be deleted from them, so anything written is permanent and has to be
   identifiable by what is already there.

   What makes a demo's rows findable is pageView. The SDK fills page_url and
   session_id on the row by itself, confirmed in Phase 0, and session_id is the
   only join between page_view_events and the other five tables. So:

     a demo's page views are found by page_url containing its slug
       -> those rows give the exact session_id list
         -> those session_ids find its cart, order, wishlist and search rows

   A page that never fires pageView writes rows belonging to no identifiable
   demo, in tables nobody can clean up. That is why pageview() is called on
   every page, before anything else, and why the guard checks every page loads
   this file.

   THE OMISSION RULE, which lives here and only here.

   Never send a price, a discount or a stock count that the scrape did not
   produce. Number(null) is 0 in JavaScript, and 0 in stock_count announces
   every product out of stock, poisoning every back-in-stock segment. That bug
   has shipped twice on the reference build. compact() below drops the key
   instead, and money() refuses to invent a number.

   Handoff 1.8. The reference build's productCatalog.js gets this wrong in the
   opposite direction, normalising an unreadable price to 0.

       sendDeviceEvent is the SDK's documented way to write a named event table with
       the payload untouched, and it is the same mechanism the reference build's own

       every field it carries, which is what wishlistRow() below is.

       Same endpoint, same table, same fields, same device and session as the ec:
       route, so the stored row is the same shape either way and the campaigns keyed
       on list_name are unaffected.

       WHAT IT COSTS. Nothing fills a field in on your behalf here, so the row goes
       out exactly as written. Add a wishlist field and add it to wishlistRow().

       HOW A CHANGE HERE IS VERIFIED. Against a row in the table, never against a
       green test. CLAUDE.md 4: an HTTP 200 from the event endpoint means accepted,

       is a fact rather than a gap, which is why a fallback is right here and an
       omission is not. Non-negotiable 5 is about never INVENTING a number; the

       The SDK supports five trigger types, and three of them are "an event with
       this name": DATA_LAYER_EVENT, CUSTOM_EVENT and DENGAGE_EVENT. All three
       read the name from the same triggerSettings.eventName field, and the panel
       describes all three as "Event name". They differ only in where the SDK
       listens:

         DATA_LAYER_EVENT   it wraps window.dataLayer.push and watches for
                            { event: <name> }
         CUSTOM_EVENT       window.addEventListener(<name>)
         DENGAGE_EVENT      window.addEventListener(<name>), same handler

       Some templates do not offer Data Layer Event at all, Typeform among them.
       A card that only pushed to the data layer was therefore dead for those,
       and dead in the worst way: nothing errors and the widget simply never
       appears, so it looks like a broken demo rather than a trigger mismatch.
       Handoff 12.6.

       So both signals go out on every press, carrying the same name. A campaign
       has exactly one trigger, so exactly one of the two is ever listened for and
       the other is discarded by the browser at no cost. The only way to see a
       widget twice is two campaigns sharing one event name, which
       factory/panel/live-campaigns.sh already reports as its nastiest case. */

       DPS- marker.

       Observed on a stored contact, 10 August 2026: a subscription submitted by an
       anonymous visitor arrived keyed sf_ followed by a uuid. The engine's own
       submit handler reads the device record, finds no contact key, mints that one,
       and only then posts the form. So the contact exists and is correct in every
       other respect, and nothing looking for the DPS- marker will ever find it.

       THE TIMING IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is why this sits here rather than
       anywhere nearer the form. The engine reads the device record at submit time,
       so a key set while the visitor is still typing has long since landed. The two
       tempting alternatives both fail: reacting to the confirmation is too late,
       because the key was minted before the post, and listening for the submit
       message races the engine's own listener for that same message.

       THE NUMBER IS A TIMESTAMP RATHER THAN A COUNTER, deliberately. Low numbers
       are the ones a pre-sales person types into the account panel during a call,

    /* THE INBOX IS HEADLESS. Dengage serves the messages and records what
       happened to them; the list, the styling and the empty state are this
       repository's job. There is no panel template that draws an inbox, so
       unlike the other on-site capabilities there is nothing to configure into
       existence: if this code is not here, the demo has no inbox.

       HOW IT IS SERVED, which is what the UI has to stay compatible with:

         dengage('InboxMessageProvider', limit)  returns a provider object
           provider.getMessages(limit)  -> Promise of an array of messages
           provider.onImpression(id)    -> the message was shown
           provider.onOpen(id)          -> the message was opened
           provider.onClick(id, button) -> a button inside it was pressed
           provider.onDelete(id)        -> the message was removed

       getMessages reads the inbox for THIS DEVICE, and the device id is
       required: the provider rejects without one. So an inbox call before the
       SDK has registered a visitor fails rather than returning an empty list,
       and the two states have to be told apart in the UI. inboxMessages()
       resolves with a status rather than throwing, so the drawer can say
       "still starting up" instead of "no messages", which are different facts.

       Push permission is NOT required. A device id exists from the moment the
       SDK initializes, so the inbox works for an anonymous visitor who has
       never seen a permission prompt. That is worth knowing on a call: the
       inbox is the way to show messaging without asking anyone to subscribe.

       The four reporting calls take the message id the provider itself
       returned. The provider looks the id up in the list it last fetched and
       silently does nothing if it is unknown, so reporting against a stale id
       is safe but pointless. Always report from the list currently on screen.

       ON DELETE, deliberately not wired by default. onDelete removes the
       message from the inbox Dengage holds for that device, and that is a
       delete against a shared account, which CLAUDE.md 1a says is never made
       without written approval for that specific object. Dismissing in the UI
       therefore hides the message locally and reports nothing. Setting
       dengage.inboxReportDelete to true in demo.config.json turns the real
       call on, and that is a decision for Salil rather than a default. */
    var INBOX_LIMIT = 20;
    var inbox = null;

    /* Resolved lazily and re-tried, never cached at load. The SDK replaces the
       queue stub with its own dispatcher when it finishes loading, and only the
       dispatcher can return a value: a call made against the stub is queued and
       replayed later, by which time its return value is gone. So asking for the
       provider too early yields nothing useful, and asking again a moment later
       is the whole fix. Validating the shape rather than probing for SDK
       internals is what makes that check survive an SDK update. */

       THE TEST FOR 'dry' IS THE APPLICATION, NOT window.dengage, and getting that
       wrong is what made this worth a comment. The bootstrap in the head installs
       the queue stub unconditionally, so window.dengage is a function on every
       page including the bare template. Testing for it therefore never reports
       'dry' and the template reports 'starting' forever: a drawer promising to
